Dear Students,

We have almost reached the end of the semester. If you are seeing this message then you have most probably successfully solved the last assessment. Well done. As I said in this first lecture, this is a challenging unit and requires you to be on top of it from week 1. If you have been doing well in the unit, take a moment to say WELL DONE to yourself. If not, take a moment to say YOU CAN DO IT to yourself. 

You should now start preparing for the final exam (if you have not already). Below is a suggested strategy and some tips for preparing for the final exam.

1. Go through the lecture slides and make sure that you understand all the concepts. If you do not understand something, watch the MULO recordings. If you still do not understand, ask on Moodle or attend a consultation. 

2. Attempt all tutorial questions. The solutions for the tutorials have been uploaded. But first try to solve the problems yourself. 

3. Go through all the algorithms covered in this unit and make sure you understand how these work, what is their space and time complexities and the proofs of correctness. Also, practice writing psuedocode for these algorithms. 

4. Attempt the questions in the past exam paper uploaded on Moodle. If you do not know how to solve a question, post it on Moodle forum and other students or I will post solution.

5. The final exam will not require you to write Python code. You will be asked only to write psuedocode. Many students decide writing Python programs when asked to write psuedocode. Although you are welcome to write Python programs, it may take more efforts to write a Python program. Writing a pseudocode is much easier because it is essentially a high level description of an algorithm that a human being can follow. However, it may require some practice on how to write pseudocode. I would suggest you to write pseudocode for a few problems and share it on Moodle forum for feedback from me and/or peers.

6. Lastly but most importantly, if you are facing any issues, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am here to help. Talk to me.

Final exam is worth 60% marks. You have worked hard to solve the four assessments. But the final exam will be make or break. So give it your best.

The above has focused solely on how to get good grades in the exam. I understand this is important for you. But a much more important thing is what you learn during your degrees. If you take units with an aim to improve your learning, you will not only get good marks but will also enjoy your studies and will learn better which is much more important than the marks in the long term. Higher marks may help you in obtaining your first job. But a better grasp on concepts and better technical skills will help you throughout your career. Think long term.

Oh, and before I sign off, below is the page from your final exam that Alice promised (I am not sure if she intentionally picked this page :P).


======================================
INSTRUCTIONS. 

You must answer ALL the questions. 

Answers to each question should be in the space DIRECTLY BELOW the questions and if required on the blank page overleaf of each question. 


GENERAL EXAM TECHNIQUE

Do not throw marks away by NOT attempting all questions. Suppose you get 7/10 on a question for a twenty minutes effort. Spending another half hour on the same question gets at most three more marks. On the other hand, were you to spend that time on a new question, you might get another ten marks. 

Answer the question that is asked of you. If the question asks for Insertion sort, do not write Quick sort. This only wastes your time. Do not write unnecessarily long answers. This wastes your valuable exam time. The question will specifically ask for the information required. Therefore, do not include the information that is not specifically asked for. If asked to justify your answer, provide a clear, logical and concise reasoning.

You do not have to attempt the questions in order. Some questions require less work but may be worth more marks. Carefully read the paper to decide the order in which you should attempt the questions based on the marks associated with each question and whether you know the answer or not. 

Several questions ask of you to write Pseudocode. Pseudocode is essentially a high level description of a program that should allow a human to understand when it is read. If you feel more comfortable using Python syntax, you are welcome to use it but do not get bogged down with syntax. What is essentially being assessed for such pseudocode questions is your basic understanding and the logic of the algorithm and not its syntactical correctness. 

Write neatly. Use a new pen not an old, leaking or splodgy pen. 

Best of Luck.
=======================================

I wish you all the best for your final exams and your careers ahead.

Cheers,
Aamir
